# How Penn Labs Apps Save You an Hour a Week
*(With Features You Probably Haven’t Tried Yet)*

If you’re anything like me, you live by your calendar. Every class, every club meeting, every lunch with a friend is color-coded and neatly slotted into Google Calendar. My Notion homework tracker is never more than a tab away. I thrive on efficiency. Why do something manually if I can automate it and never think about it again?

The truth is, Penn is busy. Between classes, clubs, dining halls, jobs, and trying to squeeze in a social life (and maybe some sleep), there just aren’t enough hours in the day. But what if I told you Penn Labs already built tools that give you some of those hours back?

I’m not talking about the famous stuff like Penn Course Alert. I mean the hidden, underutilized features — the ones most students don’t even know exist. And if you stack them together, you can easily reclaim an hour a week. Here’s how.

## 1. Auto-Sync Your Schedule *(Penn Course Plan)*

One of my least favorite tasks at the start of each semester is manually typing my classes into Google Calendar. It takes forever, and I’d always mistype a room number or forget to add recitations. Now, with **Penn Course Plan’s calendar sync**, I can turn my finalized schedule into a living calendar in seconds.

Once you’ve finished adding your classes to your cart, simply click **Download Schedule** in the top-right corner to download an `.ics` file that you can upload to your preferred calendar (Google, Apple, or Outlook). One click, one upload, and boom — your entire semester is in your calendar. Recitations included. Color-coding optional (but highly recommended).

## 2. Customize Your Penn Mobile Tab Bar

Penn Mobile isn’t just for dining menus — you can actually **edit the tab bar** to only show what you care about most. Think of it like building your own “student command center.”

Here are a couple of underrated gems worth adding:

- **Events:** A feed of upcoming events across Penn, from Venture Lab sessions to club GBMs. Instead of digging through listservs or flyers, you can see what’s happening all in one place.
- **News:** Not just the *Daily Pennsylvanian*! You can also toggle in *Under the Button* and *34th Street Mag*. Suddenly, Penn Mobile becomes your mini newsstand.

It’s small, but shaving off those tiny decision-making moments adds up. No more digging three clicks deep to find what you use every day.

## 3. Registration Metrics *(Penn Course Review)*

Everyone knows **Penn Course Review** for reviews and ratings. Fewer know about the **Registration Metrics** tab.

This feature gives you insight into:
- Average number of course openings  
- Average final enrollment  
- Percentage of sections filled during advance registration  
- Graphs of how quickly classes fill up over time  

Translation: you don’t have to guess whether that niche writing seminar will be impossible to get into. The data tells you.

When I plan my semester, these metrics save me from wasting time gambling on classes I’ll never get into. That’s peace of mind — and less last-minute scrambling when registration closes.

## 4. Laundry Timers *(Penn Mobile)*

Penn Mobile has **real-time laundry tracking** with timers and notifications. You can check machine availability before leaving your room and get a ping when your cycle’s done.

That’s easily 15 minutes per load saved. No wasted trips, no awkward hovering, no forgotten socks sitting damp for hours.

## The Labs Philosophy

Individually, these features might only save 10–20 minutes. But stack them together:

| Feature | Time Saved |
|----------|-------------|
| Auto-sync your schedule | 20 min |
| Custom Penn Mobile setup | 10 min/week |
| Registration metrics clarity | 15 min |
| Laundry timers | 15 min |

That’s an **hour a week**, easy. And in Penn time, an hour is huge — it’s one more nap, a couple more coffee chats, or one more load of laundry.

So if you, like me, get a thrill out of saving 5 minutes here and 10 minutes there, go explore these features. They’re already in the apps you use. You just have to flip the switch.

And if you’re the kind of person who gets excited about solving everyday problems in uncommon ways, maybe next semester, you’ll be **building with us** instead of just using our apps.
