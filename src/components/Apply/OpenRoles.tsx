            Connect function with form to reach users and meet their needs
            through UI/UX and graphic design. Designers create low to
            high-fidelity mockups, prototypes, and graphic assets. They also
            manage the visual language of the organization. Our toolkit includes
            Sketch, Figma, Zeplin, and Adobe Suite.

            Our products need to be taken from "lab" to real world. BizDev
            spearheads marketing, events, and collaborations to ensure that Penn
            Labs reaches real users and meets their needs. If you want to be in
            the tech industry and help grow an organization in all capacities
            (strategy, user acquisition, finance, etc), this is the role for
            you.
