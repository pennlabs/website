The Common Funding Application is an online tool designed for student-run organizations to access event funding, and for funding boards to review requests.

## All-in-one funding

Need funding for an event but don't know where to start? The CFA consolidates all funding sources into a single, easy-to-use online tool so that you can find out which funding sources your event qualifies for.

## Request, receive, repeat

Through a comprehensive online application process, the CFA allows you to request funding from multiple sources in one go.

Funding boards are able to review applications in a unified platform, allowing for quick turnaround and a smooth flow of communication between requesters and funding sources.

## Manage your applications

Keep tabs on all your current and past funding applications on your account. Never lose track of your finances, and easily copy over recurring details for future funding requests.
