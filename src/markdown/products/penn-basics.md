Penn Basics offers a customizable homepage and in-depth information on all parts of campus life, from laundry to study spaces.

## Keep an eye on your laundry

Check your go-to laundry rooms to see whether washers and dryers are available (or how long they'll take to free up). Get Chrome notifications when your laundry's done.

## On that study grind...

Use metrics like noise level, suitability for groups, and outlet abundance to find your next favorite study spot, on or off-campus.

## Let's eat!

Browse campus dining options. [COMING SOON] Food trucks: with menus, hours, and reviews (by you!).
